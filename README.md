# Pan Tilt Mechanism Version 1 - For Raspberry Pi Camera V2

The widely available pan tilt mechanism kits sold by adafruit, sparkfun or piromoni (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14391) are quite cheap and handy to setup , but lack to deliver stability. They servo necks rattles and wiggles under motion. This design uses bearings at pan and tilt positions to offer a stabler design.
